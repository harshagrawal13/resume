        \cvevent{\textbf{JESPR} - Energy Based Modelling for Proteins}{}{  May 2023 - Present}{}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Devised and currently \textit{implementing} a contrastive learning approach for the pre-training of foundational protein models, aimed at learning high-level semantic representations between sequence and structural spaces to facilitate bi-directional mapping.
            \item Also implemented sharding, activation checkpointing, and other memory-saving techniques for scalable multi-GPU training of models with 500M+ parameters.
            \item Currently evaluating zero-shot performance on protein function benchmarks such as solubility, stability, etc. (from https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02096).
            \item Code: \href{https://github.com/atom-51/jespr}{github.com/atom-51/jespr}

        \cvevent{\textbf{Cancer-eX} - Detecting Pancreatic Cancer early}{}{Aug 2018 - August 2021}{}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Studied a salivary biomarker to detect Pancreatic and other Gastrointestinal Cancers early and proposed a lateral flow assay-based system for early detection.
